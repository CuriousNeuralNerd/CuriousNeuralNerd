## 👋 About Me

I'm an Applied-AI specialist and Ph.D. student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, passionate about developing **robust, multi-modal recognition systems** for real-world deployment. With **8+ years of experience** and **10+ technical projects**, I focus on the intersection of behavioral biometrics, medical vision applications, and cutting-edge AI systems.

🔬 **Research Collaborator** at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)  
🎓 **Expected Ph.D. Completion**: 2027  
🧠 **Research Focus**: Applied AI, Behavioral Biometrics, Medical Imaging, Computer Vision  

When I'm not pushing the boundaries of AI, you'll find me spending quality time with my wife and son, hitting the gym 💪, strategizing over board games 🎲, or exploring new places ✈️.
